# Lowe's Technical Round 2

## Questions about background  

Please tell us about your background. Keep it short and preferably to 5-7 minutes.

## Technical Questions - ML Breadth

### Supervised Learning

1. Tell me what you know about Supervised Learning.
2. What are some of the Supervised Learning Algorithms?

### Linear Regression

3. Let's start with Linear Regression. What are we trying to achieve here?
4. What does the Loss Function look like here? Why?
5. How is the Loss Function minimzed? Which algorithm is used?
6. Why are we taking the square of the residuals in Loss Function? Why not the Modulus of the values? (Important)

### Logistic Regression

7. Let's move on to a classification algorithm. Can you tell me a bit about Logistic Regression?
8. Why are we fitting a Logistic Function in this problem?
9. We can also fit a line for this classification problem and define a threshold. What is the advantage of a Logistic (Sigmoid) Function? (Important)

### Random Forests

10. Let's move on to another classification algorithm, a tree-based one this time. What do you know about Random Forest?
11. Whis is it called a 'Forest', and why is it called 'Random'?
12. How do you know which feature to split on at the root of the node and at every intermediate node?
13. What is the intuitive explanation of Information Gain or Gini Impurity? (Important)
14. What is the Loss function here? Why? (Important)
