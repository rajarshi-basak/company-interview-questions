## Technical Questions

### Traditional Machine Learning

1. In Naive Bayes, what is the one big assumption that we make?
2. Assume we have a tabhular dataset with 25 variables (features) and one binary target variable. Can you explain that assumption in terms of this dataset?
3. In Random Forests, do we train all the estimators (trees) on 
   (a) All the input data and all the features
   (b) A subset of the input data and all the features
   (c) All the input data and a subset of the features
   (d) A subset of the inout data and a subset of the features

### NLP and Deep Learning

4. Do you know how Named Entity Recognition is done?
5. What is the unerlying algorithm and concept based on which simple NER systems are built?
6. If there is a training dataset with non-linear trend and you can fit either a decision tree or a neural network with no activation function, which one will you use? Why?
